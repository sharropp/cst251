	<h1>Lab 14: Typography II</h1><br>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p>The challenge presented by this lab was to try to recreate an even harder webpage that had cool typography</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>I had problems with the header area and getting it all horizontal. To fix this I used a list. I also have another problem where the image spans the whole web pages width and I don't know how to fix this.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>I now know some new methods of styling my website!</p>
