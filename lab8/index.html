	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>Most of the challenges I faced were with CSS as I am not too fluent in it. For example, I had trouble styling the image so it changes sizes when hovered over.</p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>Lots problems faced. I had problems with getting the padding uniform. Had problems with the gif spacing. Had problems with getting the text in the padding.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>From this lab I learned how to style more things using CSS which deepened my understanding of the Markup Language</p>
